1) Cuboid

The object constructor for the Cuboid class must get exactly three arguments in the following order: length, width, and height, and store these three values in length, width, and height, respectively.

The Cuboid class must have the getter SurfaceArea, which returns the surface area of the cuboid, and the getter Volume, which returns the volume of the cuboid.

2) Cube

The Cube class is a subclass of the Cuboid class. The Cube constructor function must get only one argument, its length, and use this passed value to set length, width, and height.

Hint: use super to pass the correct parameters.
